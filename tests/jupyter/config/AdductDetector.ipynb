Probabilites have to be in (0,1]. The optional RTShift param indicates the expected RT shift caused by this adduct, e.g. '(2)H4H-4:0:1:-3' indicates a 4 deuterium label, which causes early elution by 3 seconds. As fifth parameter you can add a label for every feature with this adduct. This also determines the map number in the consensus file. Adduct element losses are written in the form 'H-2'. All provided adducts need to have the same charge sign or be neutral! Mixing of adducts with different charge directions is only allowed as neutral complexes. For example, 'H-1Na:0:0.05' can be used to model Sodium gains (with balancing deprotonation) in negative mode."
