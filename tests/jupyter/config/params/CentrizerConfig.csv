signal_to_noise,0.0,0.0,0.0,Minimal signal-to-noise ratio for a peak to be picked (0.0 disables SNT estimation!)
spacing_difference_gap,4.0,4.0,4.0,The extension of a peak is stopped if the spacing between two subsequent data points exceeds 'spacing_difference_gap * min_spacing'. 'min_spacing' is the smaller of the two spacings from the peak apex to its two neighboring points. '0' to disable the constraint. Not applicable to chromatograms.
spacing_difference,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Maximum allowed difference between points during peak extension, in multiples of the minimal difference between the peak apex and its two neighboring points. If this difference is exceeded a missing point is assumed (see parameter 'missing'). A higher value implies a less stringent peak definition, since individual signals within the peak are allowed to be further apart. '0' to disable the constraint. Not applicable to chromatograms."
missing,1,1,1,Maximum number of missing points allowed when extending a peak to the left or to the right. A missing data point occurs if the spacing between two subsequent data points exceeds 'spacing_difference * min_spacing'. 'min_spacing' is the smaller of the two spacings from the peak apex to its two neighboring points. Not applicable to chromatograms.
ms_levels,"[1, 2]","[1, 2]",[],"List of MS levels for which the peak picking is applied. If empty, auto mode is enabled, all peaks which aren't picked yet will get picked. Other scans are copied to the output without changes."
report_FWHM,false,false,false,"Add metadata for FWHM (as floatDataArray named 'FWHM' or 'FWHM_ppm', depending on param 'report_FWHM_unit') for each picked peak."
report_FWHM_unit,relative,relative,relative,"Unit of FWHM. Either absolute in the unit of input, e.g. 'm/z' for spectra, or relative as ppm (only sensible for spectra, not chromatograms)."
SignalToNoise:max_intensity,-1,-1,-1,"maximal intensity considered for histogram construction. By default, it will be calculated automatically (see auto_mode). Only provide this parameter if you know what you are doing (and change 'auto_mode' to '-1')! All intensities EQUAL/ABOVE 'max_intensity' will be added to the LAST histogram bin. If you choose 'max_intensity' too small, the noise estimate might be too small as well.  If chosen too big, the bins become quite large (which you could counter by increasing 'bin_count', which increases runtime). In general, the Median-S/N estimator is more robust to a manual max_intensity than the MeanIterative-S/N."
SignalToNoise:auto_max_stdev_factor,3.0,3.0,3.0,parameter for 'max_intensity' estimation (if 'auto_mode' == 0): mean + 'auto_max_stdev_factor' * stdev
SignalToNoise:auto_max_percentile,95,95,95,parameter for 'max_intensity' estimation (if 'auto_mode' == 1): auto_max_percentile th percentile
SignalToNoise:auto_mode,0,0,0,method to use to determine maximal intensity: -1 --> use 'max_intensity'; 0 --> 'auto_max_stdev_factor' method (default); 1 --> 'auto_max_percentile' method
SignalToNoise:win_len,200.0,200.0,200.0,window length in Thomson
SignalToNoise:bin_count,30,30,30,number of bins for intensity values
SignalToNoise:min_required_elements,10,10,10,minimum number of elements required in a window (otherwise it is considered sparse)
SignalToNoise:noise_for_empty_window,1e+20,1e+20,1e+20,noise value used for sparse windows
SignalToNoise:write_log_messages,true,true,true,Write out log messages in case of sparse windows or median in rightmost histogram bin
